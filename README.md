It's been two weeks since you were hired as a nwe data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you'll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV file, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you'll perform data modelling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an ERD of the tables.
